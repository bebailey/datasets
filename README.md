Balance The Human Balance Evaluation Database contains force platform recordings from subjects undergoing stabilography tests. The subjects performed standing tasks under four different conditions: with their eyes opened or closed, while standing on a rigid or unstable surface. Each condition was tested three times, with the order of the conditions being randomized among subjects. A total of 1930 trials performed by 163 different subjects are given in this database. https://alpha.physionet.org/content/hbedb/1.0.0/  (data available at https://alpha.physionet.org/content/hbedb/1.0.0/BDSinfo.txt)

The database includes information such as gender, age, pathology, lifestyle habits (e.g. smoking, alcohol and coffee consummation), occupational status, and the results of two specific medical questionnaires: the Voice Handicap Index (VHI) and Reflux Symptom Index (RSI). https://physionet.org/content/voiced/1.0.0/
